## ðŸš€ How to Test

### Local Testing
1. **Start the backend**: `cd backend && npm start`
2. **Start the frontend**: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. **Login with two different users** in separate browser windows/tabs
4. **Start a chat** between the users
5. **Click the video/voice call buttons** in the chat header
6. **Accept the incoming call** in the other window
7. **Test the call controls** (mute, video toggle, end call)

### Network Testing (Multiple Devices)
1. **Easy method**: Run `./start-network.sh` from the project root
2. **Default method (now configured automatically)**:
   - Start backend: `cd backend && npm start`
   - Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. **For local-only development**:
   - Start backend: `cd backend && npm run start:local`
   - Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run start:local`
4. **Access from other devices**: Use the network URL shown (e.g., `http://172.20.10.3:3000`)
5. **Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi network**

### Configuration
- **Default**: Both servers now start with `HOST=0.0.0.0` for network access
- **Environment files**: `.env` files configure HOST and PORT settings
- **Local development**: Use `:local` scripts for localhost-only access

### CORS Configuration
The app now supports:
- Local development (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`)
- Network access (common private IP ranges)
- Automatic backend URL detection based on frontend URL

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing

- Test call controls with touch
- Verify auto-hiding controls work
- Test camera switching functionality
- Check fullscreen mode

## ðŸ”§ Browser Requirements

- Modern browsers with WebRTC support
- Camera and microphone permissions
- HTTPS in production (required for WebRTC)
